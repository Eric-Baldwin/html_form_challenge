        The military has moved me a lot of times. I grew up in San Diego. That is where I enlisted. The military has stationed me in Maryland, Japan, Ohio, and Colorado. I wonder if I will get stationed somewhere else in the future.

        These are apparently fun cities to visit according to the internet. I love to travel. I want to see new and exciting parts of the world.
